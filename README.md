# ISA-QAP-Instances
Quadratic Assignment Problem instances

The "QAPLIB" instances are from the Quadratic Assignment Problem Library sourced from e.g. https://coral.ise.lehigh.edu/data-sets/qaplib/

The "DreTai" instances are those proposed by Z. Drezner, P. Hahn and E. Taillard in "Recent Advances for the Quadratic Assignment Problem with Special Emphasis on Instances that are Difficult for Meta-Heuristic Methods", Annals of Operations Research 139, 65–94, 2005, sourced from http://mistic.heig-vd.ch/taillard/problemes.dir/qap.dir/qap.html

The "Palubeckis" instances are those proposed by G. Palubeckis in "Generating hard test instances with known optimal solution for the rectilinear quadratic assignment problem", Journal of Global Optimization, 1999, vol.15, n.2, 127-156, sourced from https://www.personalas.ktu.lt/~ginpalu/qproblem.html

The "DruganComposite" generator is as proposed by M. Drugan in "Generating QAP instances with known optimum solution and additively decomposable cost function", J Comb Optim (2015) 30:1138–1172. The corresponding instances are created by this generator.

The "StuFer" generator is as proposed by T. Stutzle and S. Fernandes in "New benchmark instances for the QAP and the
experimental analysis of algorithms". The corresponding instances are created by this generator.
