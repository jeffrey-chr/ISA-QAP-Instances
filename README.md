Quadratic Assignment Problem instances

The "QAPLIB" instances are from the Quadratic Assignment Problem Library sourced from e.g. https://coral.ise.lehigh.edu/data-sets/qaplib/

The "DreTai" instances are those proposed by Z. Drezner, P. Hahn and E. Taillard in "Recent Advances for the Quadratic Assignment Problem with Special Emphasis on Instances that are Difficult for Meta-Heuristic Methods", Annals of Operations Research 139, 65â€“94, 2005, sourced from http://mistic.heig-vd.ch/taillard/problemes.dir/qap.dir/qap.html

The "TermGen" instances have been created by the generator proposed by Section 2.2 of Drezner et al. (see above reference).

The "PaluGen" instances have been created by the generator proposed by G. Palubeckis in "Generating hard test instances with known optimal solution for the rectilinear quadratic assignment problem", Journal of Global Optimization, 1999, vol.15, n.2, 127-156. The "Palubeckis" instances based on the same source were previously available at https://www.personalas.ktu.lt/~ginpalu/qproblem.html which is no longer a functioning link.

The "StuFerGen" instances have been created by the generator proposed by T. Stutzle and S. Fernandes in "New benchmark instances for the QAP and the experimental analysis of algorithms". The corresponding instances are created by this generator.

The "Hypercube" instances are created by a generator novel to this work. (Citation to be added later.)
